### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Predoctoral Fellow at the **University of Oxford**. 

I graduated from the MRes in Economics at Sciences Po (@ScPoEcon) and I am also a Research Replicator for the **Journal of Political Economy** (@JPE-Reproducibility). 
Previously I contributed to the work of ECB and OECD, in addition to being a Research Replicator for the Economic Journal (EJ) and the Econometrics Journal (EctJ).

I'm passionate about (quantitative) macroeconomics and applied computational methods. 
You'll find me coding in R, Julia, Python, Stata, and a bit of MATLAB. 

Feel free to explore and reach out! ðŸš€
