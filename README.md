### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MRes Candidate in Economics at Sciences Po (@ScPoEcon) and a Research Replicator for RES (@RES-Reproducibility). Previously @ the ECB and OECD.

I'm passionate about macroeconomics and computational macro. 
You'll find me coding in R, Julia, Python, Stata, and a bit of MATLAB. 
Currently in the process of reshaping my GitHub profile!

Feel free to explore and reach out! ðŸš€
