### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MRes Candidate in Economics at Sciences Po (@ScPoEcon) and a RES (@RES-Reproducibility) Research Replicator for the Economic Journal (EJ) and the Econometrics Journal (EctJ) . Previously I contributed to the work of ECB and OECD.

I'm passionate about (quantitative) macroeconomics and applied computational methods. 
You'll find me coding in R, Julia, Python, Stata, and a bit of MATLAB. 
Currently in the process of reshaping my GitHub profile!

Feel free to explore and reach out! ðŸš€
